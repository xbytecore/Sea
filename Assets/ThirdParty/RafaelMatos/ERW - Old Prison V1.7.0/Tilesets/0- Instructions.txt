---- Important notes ----

----Unity's Rule tile system alternative----
Since Unity's default rule tile system is somehow limited and does not cover some aspects of autotiling out of the box, tilesets with multiple heights(e.g walls
with 2 or more tiles of height) have no rule tile setup. Also, whilst animated tilesets are setup and ready to use, no tile variation is set. 
To sum up, most of all tilesets are setup and ready to use.

*I'm also providing a pack of premade corners for the big walls so it's easier to build you map manually in case you're not going to use Tiled.

----TiledMap Editor alternative----
All tilesets have full autotile support and this is as easy as selecting a brush for a specific tileset and start drawing. 
The rules are setup to be used with the "Automapping while drawing" deactivaded, so all you have to do is draw and, once you
have finished, press CTRL + M or CMD + M(This is called automapping, which is the autotile version of Tiled). If you are drawing
actual terrains(tilesets with no height), then in this case you just have to draw and no further action is needed. In this case
you'd only use the built-in autotile(terrain brush(T))

TiledMap Editor is a great and well known 2D map editor. You can create maps for your game and import it 
to Unity using SuperTiled2Unity importer. A sample scene is provided.

Hint: after importing your map to Unity, if you find some errors, especially regarding the max size of
the tileset, try restarting Unity after fixing these issues. It might be fixed already but the error sometimes only dissapears after restarting.

*My tilesets' smallest area is a 2x2 grid.
