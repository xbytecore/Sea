*Notes
-Unity's Rule tile system alternative
Since Unity's default rule tile system is somehow limited and does not cover some aspects of autotiling out of the box,
tilesets with multiple heights(e.g walls with 2 or more tiles of height) have no rule tile setup. A set of premade corners are provided for these cases.

-TiledMap Editor alternative
All tilesets have full autotile support and this is as easy as selecting a brush for a specific tileset and start drawing.
