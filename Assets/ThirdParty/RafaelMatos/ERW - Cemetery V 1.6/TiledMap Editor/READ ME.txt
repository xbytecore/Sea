Important Reminder
If you change the name of a file is being referenced by some Tiled tileset(.tsx), you must open this tileset and update the reference. If you don't do that
all the content referenced by this .tsx won't load into your Unity scene. 

If you are new to Tiled + Unity and if you find some import error, I'd recommend to follow the error message. The warnings are usually pretty precise.
You can always reach me on Discord or any other of my channels to get help.


------------
While almost all platforms, walls and terrains used the corner set for the auto tile, Fences uses
the edge auto tile set because it best suits tilesets with no sides(e.g. fences). So take this
into account while drawing because it's a bit different to draw. 
Quick tip: the mouse position determines which tile will be shown to you(e.g. if you want to go the
right, lead your cursor to the right)
